Social Media Analytics Dashboard 📊
A comprehensive Java-based analytics tool that provides deep insights into social media user behavior and engagement patterns through advanced data analysis and visualization.

🎯 Overview
This project implements a robust social media analytics system that processes user interaction data to extract meaningful insights about engagement patterns, user activity levels, and content performance. Built with Java Swing for an intuitive desktop interface, it demonstrates practical applications of data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented design patterns in analyzing large-scale social media datasets.

✨ Key Features
📈 Engagement Analytics
- Average Engagement Calculator: Computes average likes per comment across the platform to measure overall user engagement quality
- Top Performing Content: Identifies posts with the most liked comments, highlighting viral or highly engaging content
- Comment Popularity Analysis: Tracks posts with the highest comment volumes to identify discussion-driving content

👥 User Behavior Analysis
- Passive User Detection: Algorithmically identifies the 5 least active users based on:
  - Post frequency and volume
  - Comment participation rates
  - Overall platform engagement metrics
  
- Active User Recognition: Highlights the top 5 most engaged users by analyzing:
  - Content creation frequency
  - Comment contributions
  - Like distribution patterns
  - Combined activity score

🔍 Advanced Metrics
- Comprehensive User Ranking System: Implements a weighted scoring algorithm that combines multiple engagement factors (posts, comments, likes received) to create holistic user activity profiles
- Custom Comparator Implementation: Utilizes Java's Comparator interface for flexible, multi-criteria user sorting
- Real-time Data Aggregation: Efficiently processes large datasets using HashMap-based data structures for O(1) lookup performance

🛠️ Technical Implementation
Architecture
- Design Pattern: Singleton pattern for centralized data management through `DataStore`
- Data Structures: Optimized HashMap implementations for efficient data retrieval and aggregation
- Sorting Algorithm: Custom `UserMapComparator` for multi-attribute user ranking
- UI Framework: Java Swing for cross-platform desktop compatibility
